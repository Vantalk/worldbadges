WorldBadges is an innovative social media platform project meant to provide high
privacy options and granular control to the user.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install Phoenix and PostgreSQL
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Setup your database with `mix ecto.reset`
  * Setup Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install && npm rebuild node-sass && npm audit fix node node_modules/brunch/bin/brunch build && cd ..`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Important:
  * You will need to specify `@host` and paths for your website files in `channels_shared.ex`.
  * Placeholder images are not included.
  * WorldBadges is still a work in progress and does not offer any warranties.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
